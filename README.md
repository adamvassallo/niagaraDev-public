# niagaraDev Website

**Version 1.0.0**

A website tracking the urban development happenings of the Niagara Region, Ontario, Canada.

I developed this site to form a central location for the Niagara urban development photos and articles I come across. The files uploaded here contain a subset of the total content on the live website (www.niagaradev.ca).
